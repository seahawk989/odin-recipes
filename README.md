# odin-recipes
Hello to whoever reading !

Hope you are doing well ! This is my first try of doing a project, following The Odin Project.

It might not look good at all (let's be honest, it is quite obvious) but the recipes are very tasty.

If you feel like experimenting give them a go.

Please note there are different variations of the same recipe and I don't advocate the ones I've used are the best.

If you are willing to try, please do your own research and pick the one that sounds most pleasing to you !

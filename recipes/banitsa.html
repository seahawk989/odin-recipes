<h2>Banitsa?</h2>
<p>Banitsa is a traditional pastry dish made in Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Southeastern Serbia.</p>
<p>It is prepared by layering a mixture of whisked eggs, natural yogurt and pieces of white brined cheese between filo pastry and then baking it in an oven.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>Bulgarian banica is traditionally prepared with homemade filo sheets, Bulgarian cheese (Sirene), and of course Bulgarian yogurt.</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup natural Greek yogurt (8 ounces/250 grams)</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>7 ounces bulgarian cheese or feta cheese (200 grams)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>6-8 filo pastry sheets</li>
    <li>½ stick unsalted butter , melted (55 grams)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350° Fahrenheit (175° Celsius).</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, take a round oven-proof dish and grease it with oil or butter and set aside.</li>
    <li>Put drained feta in a mixing bowl and crumble it with a fork (or your fingers). Add yogurt, eggs and baking soda and mix everything well. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Spread one sheet of phyllo (filo) pastry on a clean work top, the wider side facing you. Brush some melted butter over the sheet.</li>
    <li>poon some of the Feta mixture over and spread around a little. Lift the edge closest to you and roll/fold into a “sausage”.</li>
    <li>Now, roll this into a snail (like you would when making cinnamon rolls). Place the “snail” in the middle of your oven dish/cake pan.</li>
    <li>Repeat step 4 with another phyllo sheet. When ready, place it in the cake pan, just around the first “snail” and repeat with the rest of the sheets until you fill up you cake pan.</li>
    <li>When done, pour the leftover melted butter over banitsa. Transfer the pan in the oven and bake at 350° Fahrenheit (175° Celsius) for 25 minutes or until puffed and golden brown on top.</li>
    <li>When ready, take it out and let it cool slightly before slicing.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
